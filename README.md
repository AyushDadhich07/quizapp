# Full Stack React Application

This project consists of a React frontend and a Python-based backend.

## Frontend

The frontend is a React application created with Create React App.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
cd frontend


2. Install dependencies:
npm install


### Frontend Scripts

- Start the development server:
npm start


- Run tests:
npm test



- Build for production:
npm run build


## Backend

The backend is a Python-based application.

### Backend Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv


2. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS and Linux:
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

3. Install required dependencies (add dependencies in `requirements.txt` as necessary):
pip install -r requirements.txt


### Backend Scripts

- Start the backend server:
python manage.py runserver

- Run backend tests:
python manage.py test



### GROQ API Setup

This project integrates with the Groq API. To use the API, you'll need to set up your own `GROQ_API_KEY`.

1. Obtain your `GROQ_API_KEY` by signing up for the Groq API at their official website.

2. Once you have the key, add it to your environment variables or include it in your applicationâ€™s configuration. For local development, you can set it by creating a `.env` file in the root of your backend directory with the following contents:
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here


3. Ensure that your application reads the key from the environment:
```python
import os

GROQ_API_KEY = os.getenv('GROQ_API_KEY')
'''
